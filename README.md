Java Beginners course
---

Welcome to a self paced course for those who want to become Java Engineers (if you're a big boy already, 
check out [Java Professionals course](https://github.com/qala-io/java-course)). This course is for you if:

* You don't know programming at all or started to learn it recently
* You're not sure about what to learn first and what can be postponed
* You know Java syntax, but you don't know how real programmers put it all together to create real software

This course doesn't replace books, in fact it relies on you reading books. It consists of a series of 
steps that you'll need to go through to write a realistic web app. The steps will tell you which information you
need to know to accomplish the tasks, but you'll have to find and read the actual literature by yourself. 

# Task description

You'll need to implement an analogue of [Trello](https://trello.com), so get yourself acquainted with this site. 
It requires a lot of efforts even to implement a very simplistic version. But our main goal is to learn 
real-life programming and not to earn money. 

If you have your own idea that you'd like to implement instead - that's great. Just make sure that:

* Your app is suitable to be a web app (to work in a browser)
* It will have data that needs to be stored in database
* Users will have to log in to work with the app
* Look over the tasks below and try to come up with some analogous tasks for your own app

# Programme

Within the course you're going to have steps to accomplish - most of them will be reading, practicing. There will be 
questions that you should be able to answer (at least to yourself) - please make sure you don't skip this part.
