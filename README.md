This programme is for those who doesn't know how to write software. For those who is overwhelmed with 
information on the Internet and doesn't understand which direction to take and what to study in particular.

This course doesn't contain teaching material itself. Instead it consists of a series of steps that you'll 
need to go through to write a realistic web app.

# Task description

You'll need to implement an analogue of [Trello](https://trello.com). It requires a lot of efforts even to implement
a very simplistic version. But our main goal is to learn real-life programming and not to earn money. 

If you have your own idea that you'd like to implement instead - that's great. Just make sure that:

* Your app is suitable to be a web app (to work in a browser)
* It will have data that needs to be stored in database
* Users will have to log in to work with the app
* Look over the tasks below and try to come up with some analogous tasks for your own app

# Programme

Be prepared that this whole thing may take a year or even more. Most people get frustrated with the learning
process because they expect quick results. But it doesn't work that way - learning programming is a slow process 
that often takes 5 years or more. Though by that time you're likely to get a job and keep learning at work.
