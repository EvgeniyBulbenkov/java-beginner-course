# Tests (TBD)

While developers write code to solve some real-world problems, we also need to check that our code works. When we
keep adding new code into our project there is a risk that we break something that previously worked. In real life
this happens _all the time_. Thus we have to check whether it still works - it's called testing. There are 2 choices: 

* You can keep re-checking your code manually. This is super tedious and time-consuming, which means you'll
start skipping some checks after a while. This will result in a poorly working software.
* Or you can write yet another code (automated tests) that checks the main code (production code)
