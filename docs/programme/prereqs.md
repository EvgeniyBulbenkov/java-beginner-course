* Start reading a book for Java beginners (e.g. 2 volumes by [Horstmann](http://horstmann.com/corejava/index.html))
* Things that you need to know before starting next steps:
   * Primitives, strings
   * Loops and conditions: `if`, `for`
   * Classes, fields, static fields, methods, constructors, objects (instances)
   * Difference between comparing references (`==`) and data (`equals()`)
* You can read the rest of the book in parallel with this course
* Things that you can skip completely:
   * AWT, Swing or JavaFX (tools for desktop apps). We're going to build a web app, desktop development is 
   not very popular nowadays.
   * Stream API (don't confuse with IO streams) and closures aren't important unless you want to understand 
   someone else's code that utilizes them. 
* Get acquainted with official Java naming/formatting conventions, there will be examples in this course so you 
should be able to get the drift without giving it much of a thought. But understand that it's common in dev 
community to get angry if they see common conventions violated. So start getting used to the conventions from the 
beginning.
